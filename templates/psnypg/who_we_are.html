							<h3>Brief History</h3>
							<p>The Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria - Young Pharmacists Group (PSN-YPG) is an 
								interest group within the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN), dedicated to 
								fostering the growth and development of Young Pharmacists.<br>
								Membership is open to all Pharmacists licensed by the Pharmacists Council of 
								Nigeria (PCN) who are 35 years old or younger and/or within five years 
								post-graduation from an accredited Pharmacy school.<br><br>
								PSN-YPG was founded in 2012 as an evolution of the Young Pharmacists' 
								Forum (YPF), aligning with the global model of the Early Career Pharmacists’ 
								Group (ECPG) of the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP). It was 
								created to empower early-career Pharmacists, bridge generational gaps in 
								leadership, and amplify the collective voice of young professionals in shaping the future of Pharmacy in Nigeria.<br><br>
								At its core, PSN-YPG thrives on the synergy of innovation, intellectual capacity, 
								and youthful energy. Beyond professional development, the Group is committed to 
								driving positive change within the Pharmacy profession and society at large. 
								Through continuous learning, leadership grooming, and strategic collaborations, 
								PSN-YPG continues to redefine the role of Young Pharmacists—transforming them into 
								change makers, thought leaders, and key contributors to national and global healthcare systems.</p>
